Hello everyone and welcome to the documentation of the research project "Mental image decoding", conducted within the MSc5 course Computational Neuroscience at the Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main.

## Mental image decoding

This research report takes you to different steps of the whole research process. 

You can use the following sections to navigate through the content of the research report:

# * [Whats happening in this research project?]

* [Theoretical background & Research question](https://JNPauli.github.io/Mental-image-decoding/general_information/Research_question.html)

   Why did I choose this specific topic and what has already been discussed regarding mental imagery?

* [Data and Projectmanagment](https://JNPauli.github.io/Mental-image-decoding/general_information/Data_and_Projectmanagment.html)

   How did I acquire the data? Where is everything else documented? Is this project FAIR?

* [Data Exploration](https://JNPauli.github.io/Mental-image-decoding/code/Dataset_Exploration.html)

   Exploration and further explanation of the Data

* [Genereal linear Model](https://m-earnest.github.io/course_template_diler/content/intro_content.html)

   Why should one run a glm in the first place? Which modules did I use? 
 
* [Machine Learning](https://m-earnest.github.io/course_template_diler/general_information/results_communication.html)

   What kind of different algorithms did I use? How did it work out?

* [Symposium](https://m-earnest.github.io/course_template_diler/general_information/symposium.html)

   What to do about outreach and discourse creation?


* [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion](https://m-earnest.github.io/course_template_diler/general_information/dei.html)

   What to look out for, what to keep in mind and how to trear each other.

* [Code of Conduct](https://m-earnest.github.io/course_template_diler/general_information/CoC.html)

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive learning
   experience.

## Acknowledgements

Huge thanks to Peer Herholz for investing a lot of time to create the fantastic course about computational neuroscience and being almost always available round the clock for questions. To Michael Ernst for maintaing the course and being a great lecturer and Maren Wehrheim for supporting me a lot in the machine learning parts.
