Hello everyone and welcome to the documentation of the research project "Mental image decoding", conducted within the MSc5 course Computational Neuroscience at the Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main.

## Mental image decoding

This research report takes you to different steps of the whole research process. 

You can use the following sections to navigate through the content of the research report:

## Whats happening in this research project?

* [Theoretical background & Research question](https://JNPauli.github.io/Mental-image-decoding/general_information/Research_question.html)

   Why did I choose this specific topic and what has already been discussed regarding mental imagery?

* [Data and Projectmanagment](https://JNPauli.github.io/Mental-image-decoding/general_information/Data_and_Projectmanagment.html)

   How did I acquire the data? Where is everything else documented? Is this project FAIR?

* [Data Exploration](https://JNPauli.github.io/Mental-image-decoding/data/Dataset_Exploration.html)

   Exploration and further explanation of the Data

* [Genereal linear Model](https://JNPauli.github.io/Mental-image-decoding/data/Genereal_linear_model.html)

   Why should one run a glm in the first place? Which modules did I use? 
 
* [Machine Learning](https://jnpauli.github.io/Mental-image-decoding/general_information/Machine_Learning.html)

   What kind of different algorithms did I use? How did it work out?

* [Symposium](https://m-earnest.github.io/course_template_diler/general_information/symposium.html)

   What to do about outreach and discourse creation?

## Google presentation

In the summer semester 2022, a presentation for this project was created. This presentation depicts the visions I had for this project at the given time. Please follow this [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hdF_vYehPPWYPMLEpF6A8M-vYMSxDagZfov6lBnF_cA/edit?usp=sharing) if you are interested in how the project looked in july 2022.

## I've got a question!

A great way to do this is to open an issue on the GitHub site of the course. You can of course further contact me via [E-mail](paulijanos@gmail.com). Every feedback or idea  you might have is highly appreciated and valued.


## Acknowledgements

Huge thanks to Peer Herholz for investing a lot of time to create the fantastic course about computational neuroscience and being almost always available round the clock for questions. To Michael Ernst for maintaing the course and being a great lecturer and Maren Wehrheim for supporting me a lot in the machine learning parts.
