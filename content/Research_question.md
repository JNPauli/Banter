# Research Question aka what is this project all about?

This research project deals with the field of mental imagery. Mental imagery refers to the imagination of a certain object, scene, person etc..

Typically mental imagery is investigated by combining fMRI and machine learning techniques. fMRI has the adavantage of a high spatial resolution, altough it comes with a poor temporal resolution. The given brain activity, recorded in the fMRI, can then be decoded through machine learning. A popular approach would be a classifier like the logistic regression or the support vector machine. To decode brain activity means, in general, to classify the activity into a given category. For example, a participant could look at cats and dogs in an fMRI experiment. Decoding in this example would mean that the machine learning algorithm could predict, whether the participant was seeing a dog or a cat, given the respective voxel pattern. Decoding has been around many years and has been proven to work quite well, see [Naselaris et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910010657?casa_token=1Uey6U2ByjwAAAAA:6qHcdw5hdNlKg6e-WymuGXcqPSg2zu648D_dCGAQNe5DEtIpaQp4h8DE-EdaCCbLw8DVA-uE9A)
In terms of mental imagery, the participant would imagine those images of a cat or dog.
