# This repository contains the relevant code, openlab notebook and information regarding the decoding of mental imagery with the use of fMRI data. This project will analyze the following opensource dataset (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001506/versions/1.3.1).
Aim of this project is to decode both mental imagery stimuli and natural stimuli presented in the study. This will allow a comparison in decoding between imagined and visually seen images.

Information regarding the project status is stored in the openlab labbook folder. Exploration and analysis of the dataset can be found in the code folder. This project can also be found on OSF (https://osf.io/t2psq/?view_only=b10b5ba8e32f441493407cd2885e688b).
