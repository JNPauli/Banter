The research project is part of the MSc05 module "cognitive and computational neuroscience" of the psychology masters program from the Goethe-University Frankfurt. 

## Overview
This repository contains the relevant code, openlab notebook and information regarding the decoding of mental imagery with the use of fMRI data. This project will analyze the following [openneuro dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001506/versions/1.3.1). The respective paper can be found [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006633).This project can also be found on [OSF](https://osf.io/t2psq/?view_only=b10b5ba8e32f441493407cd2885e688b).

Aim of this project is to decode brain activity from an mental imagery paradigm.
