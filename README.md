## Overview
This repository contains the relevant code, openlab notebook and information regarding the decoding of mental imagery with the use of fMRI data. This project will analyze the following [opensource dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001506/versions/1.3.1). The respective paper can be found [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006633).This project can also be found on [OSF](https://osf.io/t2psq/?view_only=b10b5ba8e32f441493407cd2885e688b).

Aim of this project is to decode brain activity during two conditions, in which mental imagery and natural stimuli are presented, respectively. This will allow a comparison in decoding between imagined and visually seen images and answering the question, whether the quality of decoding is equal for both types of stimuli.

## Structure
Information regarding the project status is stored in the openlab labbook folder. Exploration and analysis of the dataset can be found in the code folder.
