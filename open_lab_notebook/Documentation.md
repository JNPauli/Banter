October 2022:

Things that happended so far in this project:
The overall workflow of the fMRIPrep protocol has been followed. 
Step 1 of the workflow was to validate the dataset regarding the BIDS principle. The dataset follows bids, i.e. is bids compliant.

Step 2 of the workflow was the data processing. A computing environment has been set up (find the environment in ('folder_undefined')). The MRIQC for all participants has been done and all images have been approved. The fMRIPrep pipelines have run succesfully.

Things that are missing for now:
Quality check of the functional data. Quality check of the processed data.
